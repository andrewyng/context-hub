# Telnyx Voice Gather JavaScript SDK Coding Guidelines

You are a Telnyx Voice Gather API expert. Help the user write correct, production-ready code using the official Telnyx JavaScript SDK.

## Golden Rule: Use the Official SDK

Always use the official `telnyx` package. Do not fabricate API endpoints or SDK methods.

- **Correct:** `import Telnyx from 'telnyx'`
- **Incorrect:** unofficial or outdated Telnyx packages

## Installation

```bash
npm install telnyx
```

## Setup

```javascript
import Telnyx from 'telnyx';

const client = new Telnyx({
  apiKey: process.env['TELNYX_API_KEY'], // This is the default and can be omitted
});
```

All examples below assume `client` is already initialized as shown above.

## Add messages to AI Assistant

Add messages to the conversation started by an AI assistant on the call.

`POST /calls/{call_control_id}/actions/ai_assistant_add_messages`

Optional: `client_state` (string), `command_id` (string), `messages` (array[object])

```javascript
const response = await client.calls.actions.addAIAssistantMessages('call_control_id');

console.log(response.data);
```

Returns: `result` (string)

## Start AI Assistant

Start an AI assistant on the call. **Expected Webhooks:**

- `call.conversation.ended`
- `call.conversation_insights.generated`

`POST /calls/{call_control_id}/actions/ai_assistant_start`

Optional: `assistant` (object), `client_state` (string), `command_id` (string), `greeting` (string), `interruption_settings` (object), `transcription` (object), `voice` (string), `voice_settings` (object)

```javascript
const response = await client.calls.actions.startAIAssistant('call_control_id');

console.log(response.data);
```

Returns: `conversation_id` (uuid), `result` (string)

## Stop AI Assistant

Stop an AI assistant on the call.

`POST /calls/{call_control_id}/actions/ai_assistant_stop`

Optional: `client_state` (string), `command_id` (string)

```javascript
const response = await client.calls.actions.stopAIAssistant('call_control_id');

console.log(response.data);
```

Returns: `result` (string)

## Gather

Gather DTMF signals to build interactive menus. You can pass a list of valid digits. The `Answer` command must be issued before the `gather` command.

`POST /calls/{call_control_id}/actions/gather`

Optional: `client_state` (string), `command_id` (string), `gather_id` (string), `initial_timeout_millis` (int32), `inter_digit_timeout_millis` (int32), `maximum_digits` (int32), `minimum_digits` (int32), `terminating_digit` (string), `timeout_millis` (int32), `valid_digits` (string)

```javascript
const response = await client.calls.actions.gather('call_control_id');

console.log(response.data);
```

Returns: `result` (string)

## Gather stop

Stop current gather. **Expected Webhooks:**

- `call.gather.ended`

`POST /calls/{call_control_id}/actions/gather_stop`

Optional: `client_state` (string), `command_id` (string)

```javascript
const response = await client.calls.actions.stopGather('call_control_id');

console.log(response.data);
```

Returns: `result` (string)

## Gather using AI

Gather parameters defined in the request payload using a voice assistant. You can pass parameters described as a JSON Schema object and the voice assistant will attempt to gather these informations.

`POST /calls/{call_control_id}/actions/gather_using_ai` — Required: `parameters`

Optional: `assistant` (object), `client_state` (string), `command_id` (string), `gather_ended_speech` (string), `greeting` (string), `interruption_settings` (object), `language` (object), `message_history` (array[object]), `send_message_history_updates` (boolean), `send_partial_results` (boolean), `transcription` (object), `user_response_timeout_ms` (integer), `voice` (string), `voice_settings` (object)

```javascript
const response = await client.calls.actions.gatherUsingAI('call_control_id', {
  parameters: {
    properties: 'bar',
    required: 'bar',
    type: 'bar',
  },
});

console.log(response.data);
```

Returns: `conversation_id` (uuid), `result` (string)

## Gather using audio

Play an audio file on the call until the required DTMF signals are gathered to build interactive menus. You can pass a list of valid digits along with an 'invalid_audio_url', which will be played back at the beginning of each prompt. Playback will be interrupted when a DTMF signal is received.

`POST /calls/{call_control_id}/actions/gather_using_audio`

Optional: `audio_url` (string), `client_state` (string), `command_id` (string), `inter_digit_timeout_millis` (int32), `invalid_audio_url` (string), `invalid_media_name` (string), `maximum_digits` (int32), `maximum_tries` (int32), `media_name` (string), `minimum_digits` (int32), `terminating_digit` (string), `timeout_millis` (int32), `valid_digits` (string)

```javascript
const response = await client.calls.actions.gatherUsingAudio('call_control_id');

console.log(response.data);
```

Returns: `result` (string)

## Gather using speak

Convert text to speech and play it on the call until the required DTMF signals are gathered to build interactive menus. You can pass a list of valid digits along with an 'invalid_payload', which will be played back at the beginning of each prompt. Speech will be interrupted when a DTMF signal is received.

`POST /calls/{call_control_id}/actions/gather_using_speak` — Required: `voice`, `payload`

Optional: `client_state` (string), `command_id` (string), `inter_digit_timeout_millis` (int32), `invalid_payload` (string), `language` (enum: arb, cmn-CN, cy-GB, da-DK, de-DE, en-AU, en-GB, en-GB-WLS, en-IN, en-US, es-ES, es-MX, es-US, fr-CA, fr-FR, hi-IN, is-IS, it-IT, ja-JP, ko-KR, nb-NO, nl-NL, pl-PL, pt-BR, pt-PT, ro-RO, ru-RU, sv-SE, tr-TR), `maximum_digits` (int32), `maximum_tries` (int32), `minimum_digits` (int32), `payload_type` (enum: text, ssml), `service_level` (enum: basic, premium), `terminating_digit` (string), `timeout_millis` (int32), `valid_digits` (string), `voice_settings` (object)

```javascript
const response = await client.calls.actions.gatherUsingSpeak('call_control_id', {
  payload: 'say this on call',
  voice: 'male',
});

console.log(response.data);
```

Returns: `result` (string)
